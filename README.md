# Temperature prediction algorithm v1.0.0
**Note: This project has three parts, Data Visualisation, Data Collection and Server creation**
## Data processing and visualisation
### Directions of use
- Clone the library to your System.
- Run pip to install requirements that are necessary, **It is recommended to have anaconda installed on your system**
- Run the iPython Notebook on jupyter lab
- Requirements
  - Turicreate
  - Datetime
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib.pyplot

## Using the ESP8266 for data collection with thingspeak
### Directions of use
- Create a simple Temperature sensor using two sensors.
  - A probe type temperature
  - An Ambient Temperature sensor
- Use the arduino IDE to collect data and send the data to thingspeak using API
- Export the code from thingspeak

```diff
- Pending: Export model, create server.
+ Complete: Basic MVP for Class project purposes.

! Direction Forward:
! Export model.
! Create seperate files for model creation - createModel.py
! Create seperate model for real time prediction and working.
```

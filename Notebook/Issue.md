# The issue

- Getting the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing an *.ipynb on a GitHub blob page.
```diff
+ Probably a problem with the GitHub notebook viewing tool - sometimes github fails to render the ipynb notebooks, I believe that is some temporary (and recurring) issue with their backend
A workaround

+ Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.
```
### Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
### Paste this link - https://github.com/shuklasaharsh/IOT_Temperatur_ESP8266/blob/main/Notebook/Time%20predictor%20backend.ipynb

```diff
+ The Notebook should be visible.
```
